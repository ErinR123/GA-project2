# RUN START

Run start is a fitness and wellness tracker. Designed so users can track/plan their movement, sleep and mindfulness for the week with options for updating or deleting depending on user choice. In additon to the tracking/planning the app also provides a seperate page with resources for users to help plan their week. Designing the UX was a very rewarding part of this project.

## Tech stack:

Java Script, HTML, CSS, Express, MongoDB.

## Ice Box Items:

Additonally I would like the user to have options for multiple weeks. I would like a nutrition section and the user to be able to track their KM'S of the selected movement.
